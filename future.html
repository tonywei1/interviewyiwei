				Will Lu says that he's not sure if he wants to be an artist or a writer in the future, but he would certainly not study math and science since he doesn't have that much interests in them. He has strong passions in liberal arts and studio arts and literature. He now has many of his works like his drawings and his poems hanging in his room. He also is strongly interested in collecting drawings that are usually very expensive from famous people. For his future goals, he wants to go to Boston College for undergraduate to study liberal arts and studio arts. He wants to remain in Eastern Coast after graduating from Boston College to continue pursuing his career in arts.</p>
