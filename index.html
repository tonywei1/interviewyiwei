				This is a paragraph about [Yiwei Lu]<br>
				Will Lu, also called Yiwei, is a fine young man, who is currently a junior in St. Mark's high school. He has strong passions in many areas. In leisure time, he likes to write poems to express his emotions and his concerns regarding current society. He likes to post his poems regularly on his social medias to be appreciated by his peers.<br>
				Apart from his interests in writing poem, he also likes classics, liberal arts, and literature. He is currently taking two classics class simulateneously this year and he is an active participant in school's theater program. He likes to read books. He read numerous every week in the past year, but because of the heavy workload in his junior year, the speed becomes significant slower. He tells me that he enjoys his time being alone in his room.<br>
				For sports, he likes wrestling, running and working out. He was a cross country runner, a wrestler and a rower, but because of his conflicts with theater programs and art projects, he quit all three sport teams and pursue his interests in studio arts for afternoon extracurricular activities. Despite his absence in participating in sport teams, he still is very fit and is an absolutely extraodinary athlete.
