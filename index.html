				This is a paragraph about [Yiwei Lu]<br>
				Will Lu, also called Yiwei, is a fine young man, who is currently a junior in St. Mark's high school. He has strong passions in many areas. In leisure time, he likes to write poems to express his emotions and his concerns regarding current society. His poems were once posted on the Vindex, a St. Mark's School's official magazine used for posting fine works(poems,drawings,etc.) done by outstanding young men like Yiwei. He also posts his poems regularly on his social medias to be appreciated by his peers.<br>
				Apart from his interests in writing poem, he also likes to learn everything about classics, liberal arts, and literature in his free time. He is currently taking two classics class simulateneously this year and he is an active participant in school's theater program. He also likes to read books. He read numerous every week in the past year, but because of the heavy workload in his junior year, the speed becomes significant slower. He tells me that he enjoys his time being alone in his room.<br>
				For sports, he likes wrestling, running and working out. He was a JV cross country runner, a Varsity Wrestling and Varsity Crew athlete, but because of his conflicts with theater programs and art projects, he quit all three sport teams and pursue his interests in art and literature for afternoon extracurricular activities. Despite his absence in participating in sport teams, he is still very fit and is an absolutely extraodinary athlete.
