				Will Lu is from Shanghai, the biggest and best city in China. We sometimes go back to Shanghai in break together. There are a lot of people from Shanghai in St. Mark's School. He tells me he often misses his home, Shanghai, while studying here. I miss Shanghai too. My best bros are all in Shanghai. </p>
