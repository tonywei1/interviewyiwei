					Yiwei has a lot of hobbies. The favorite thing he likes to do when staying in his room alone is watching youtube videos. He says that it is his favorite time of the day, to just sitting in his room, pulling off his curtain, pulling out his computer, MacBook Air, which he wants to change in a couple of years, and watching some videos on youtube, no matter what kinds of videos those are. <br>
					Another thing he likes to do is reading books. He admits he is not a biggest fan of reading, but reading no doubt brings him many benefits both academically and socially. Sometimes when he is not in the condition of reading, he would find himself lost while reading books, and learning nothing after all. But nowadays, when he is relieved from all the funs he had in Youtube, all the pressures he had either from academics or from social life, he would sit quietly on his chair, and start to read a few pages of a book. He says that he is starting to like the feeling of reading a book alone without anyone's interruption in recent days. He also indicates that the benefits of reading are demonstrated in his essays for history and literature, which he often gets high grades on.<br>
					He likes hanging out with friends. That is no doubt, But what does he do when being with friends? Will Yiwei Lu, this outstanding young student who has excellence in many areas, be like normal teenagers, just chatting with friends and looking at phones? Not quite. He often likes to play some card games with friends although not all of his friends know how to play those cards. <br>One card game that he likes the most among all the kinds of card games would be undoubtedly The Romance of Three Kingdoms, which is translated from chinese San Guo Sha. Americans may not undersThis is a strategic card game like Magic and Hearthstone, and many Chinese teenagers like to play it. <br>
					OVerall, writing poems is his fourth favorite thing to do in his leisure time. He is dedicated to writing poems, and sometimes when I come to his room, I would often find out he is pullin an all-nighter, not preping for a test, not reading some comic books, not playing games, but writing his poems. When writing poems, he says that his heart is pure, nothing is inside his heart except the will of writing a good poem. He told me he treat the poems he wrote like his children since they are the work produced by him using countless efforts. He uses his poems to explain his emotions and his concerns about the current society. Some deep social issues are reflected in his poems.
